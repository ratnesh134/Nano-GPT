# Building a GPT: README

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, inspired by the "Zero to Hero" series by Andrej Karpathy. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing key concepts in language modeling using self-attention mechanisms.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the process of creating a GPT model, focusing on:

Data preparation and preprocessing.

The theoretical foundation of self-attention mechanisms.

Implementation of an attention-based architecture for language modeling.

## Dataset

The Tiny Shakespeare dataset is used in this project. It is a text corpus containing excerpts from Shakespeare's works, suitable for training character-level language models.

## Dataset Details

Source: Tiny Shakespeare Dataset

Size: Approximately 1.1 MB.

Key Concepts Covered

Self-Attention

Explains the communication mechanism where nodes (tokens) aggregate information through weighted sums.

Discusses triangular masking for autoregressive settings.

Scaled Attention

Adjusts weights to ensure stability and prevents saturation during softmax computation.

Positional Encoding

Highlights the importance of encoding positional information for tokens in a sequence.
